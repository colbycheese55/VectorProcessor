     * Supported Vector Formats:
     * - note: for 2D vectors enter [magnitude z] [e z] [distance z] and [phi] as 0, enter [theta z] as 90
     * - Polar Coordinates: [magnitude], [theta x], [theta y], [theta z] ::: ex. 100, 120, 30, 90
     * - Cartesian Coordinates: [magnitude x]i + [magnitude y]j + [magnitude z]k ::: ex. 100i+200j+-300k
     * -- note: even if it means typing "+-" you must separate values by a plus sign
     * - Unit Vector: [magnitude]e where e=[e x]i+[e y]j+[e z]k ::: ex. 200e where e=0.6i+0.5j+0.3k
     * -- note: even if it means typing "+-" you must separate values by a plus sign
     * - Theta and Phi: [magnitude], [theta], [phi] ::: ex. 100, 45, 10
     * - Directional unit vector: [magnitude]; [distance x]; [distance y]; [distance z] ::: ex. 100; 10; -5; 2
     * - note: all vectors must originate from the same point
     * 
     * - always run the main() method, rather than an individual method
